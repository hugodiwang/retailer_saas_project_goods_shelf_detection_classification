# retailer_saas_project_goods_shelf_detection_classification
This is my final tensorflow 2 project provided by Greektime technology Bootcamp. In this project, we use retina network to detect goods shelf and resnet 50 to classify goods. After that, we use flask to package our trained model into a saas web service. For deployment, we build our docker image and post it to docker hub. Since I move all my documents from google colab and dockers to github. The files are too big and I have to only update codes to github for future review. The file structure are not accessible anymore.
